# RISE D6.1 Data Files

This repository will contain the input files used for the proof of concept developed as part of
Task 6.1 of the [RISE project](http://rise-eu.org/home/), in which the integration of RISE
innovations in the fields of operational earthquake loss forecasting (OELF), rapid loss
assessment (RLA) and structural health monitoring (SHM) has been demonstrated.

These files are intended to be run with the
[Real-Time Loss Tools](https://git.gfz-potsdam.de/real-time-loss-tools/real-time-loss-tools).

## Attribution of individual data files

Coming soon.
